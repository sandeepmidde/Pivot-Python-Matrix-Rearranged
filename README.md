# Pivot-Python-Matrix-Rearranged

Pivot and Unpivot functions in Oracle SQL transpose the data. 
But that takes a set of static column names and is quite time taking and elaborate. 
The same functionality can be done easily using Python, stack function. 

Update: Input contains more than 1 field that had to be present across all rows.
New file format and updated code have been attached. 

Sample test file is also created.
